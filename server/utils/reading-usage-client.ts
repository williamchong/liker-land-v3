/**
 * Forwards paced reading/TTS usage to the likecoin-api reading-usage ledger.
 * The shared service secret (not the user JWT) is what proves the usage passed through
 * this backend's wall-clock pacing — the anti-fraud boundary the payout pipeline trusts.
 * Splits each delta into the rev-share-eligible slice (paid Plus + borrowed) that funds
 * the payout pool and the non-library remainder (owned/non-Plus reads) that the API
 * records for publisher engagement stats only. Best-effort: errors are logged, never
 * thrown, so it never blocks reading-session bookkeeping; still awaited so it settles
 * before the serverless handler returns.
 *
 * Each call carries a unique `id` so the API can dedup retries: the ledger increments are
 * non-idempotent, but ofetch resends the same body (same id) on a transient `<no response>`,
 * and the API skips an already-seen id. That's what makes enabling retry here safe — it must
 * stay paired with the API-side dedup (deploy the API before this).
